------------------------------------------
Files Included
------------------------------------------
1. NLP_Assignment_Q1_to_Q3.ipynb  
   a) Contains implementation of the baseline model, 10-fold cross-validation, and error analysis.  
   b) Covers Questions 1 to 3.  

2. NLP_Assignment_Q4.ipynb  
   a) Includes all model optimization work: preprocessing improvements, TF-IDF representation, 
      hyperparameter tuning, and the addition of stylistic + lexicon features.  
   b) Covers Question 4.  

3. sentiment-dataset.tsv  
   Dataset used for training and testing the sentiment classifier.  

4. positive-words.txt / negative-words.txt  
   External opinion lexicons used for sentiment-based feature extraction.  

5. Coursework_Report.pdf  
   Two-page written report summarizing methods, experiments, and final model results.  

------------------------------------------
Instructions to Run
------------------------------------------
1. Open either notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
2. Ensure the dataset and lexicon files are in the same directory as the notebooks.  
3. Select **Kernel → Restart & Run All** to execute the notebook from start to finish.  
4. All outputs (F1 scores, tables, plots) will be displayed directly in the notebook.  

------------------------------------------
Notes
------------------------------------------
- The notebooks are self contained and will automatically download any missing NLTK resources.  
- The final model (in Q4) achieves an F1 score of approximately 0.863, above the 0.85 baseline.
